Made some progress today with:
1. Updated my <a href="https://josephbalog.com/Portfolio/"> portfolio </a> site details. Need to learn about DB's.
2. Talked to old dorm boss about a site. Learned need to charge what I'm worth and not undersell myself.
3. Worked with new theme <a href="https://bigfontsite.com/download/phlox-bc.html">Phlox</a>
