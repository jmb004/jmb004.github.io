Made some progress today with:
1. Finished my development <a href="https://josephbalog.com/Portfolio/"> portfolio </a> pages.
2. Practiced or re-learned a lot of CSS to get my blog & splash pages looking just right.
3. Began learning about font styling or typography (Great tools = www.typewolf.com www.whatfontis.com )
