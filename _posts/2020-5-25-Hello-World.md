Made some progress today with:
1. Recommend following Gary Vaynerchuck <a href="https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/">for all your business ideas</a>.
2. Learned about Ethics in Software Design <a href="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/o1LShsxF/video-0f4d30a4e8_hd.mp4">Check out this out (1hr)</a>.
3. Got an insight about speed. It's better to be giving users, the other, the control and let them decide for themselves. #insights
