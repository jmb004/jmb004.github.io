Top Tips
1. One of my favorite tools has been <a href="www.whatfontis.com">whatfontis </a> for when you need to find a font from a photo. You can import it and get the resolution correct to be able to find out what the font is, or atleast, a close relative. It has been very useful.

2. While a little outdated, this repo of resources for web-dev has been very valuable. It has been most useful to me in giving me websites to get free media from. Some of the services have changed, but the breakdown order of the parts needed to build a successful site are all there. Recommend: <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/300-awesome-free-things-e07b3cd5fd5b"> awesome-free-things</a>

3. If you haven't found this site yet then you are living in the stone-age. CSS-Tricks is a classic go-to for how to master CSS. <a href="https://css-tricks.com"> css-tricks</a>

4. I think every webdeveloper should have this site bookmarked. It's part of the process where you need to check if your website is going Live, which usually takes 24 hours after a DNS change. <a href="https://www.whatsmydns.net">whatsmydns </a>

5. I signed up for this service and never used it, but it is a useful note that many webhosts offer an affiliate service to make additional revenue on the sale of your website. For each website you get a kick-back depending on the serive the customer purchased. <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/cgi/partner">bluehost </a>

6. A solid provider of free (and nearly-free) high-quality photos for backgrounds,  banners, and splash pages. <a href="https://unsplash.com">unsplash </a>

7. A must have tool for sharing pictures during debugging or customer review. Simply paste your screenshot and make edits, then you can share it right away and get the feedback you need. <a href="https://paste.pics/">paste </a>

8. Another utility tool for the backend of web-dev. <a href="https://www.whoismyisp.org/">whoismyisp </a> is a must have for knowing whose Internet Support Provider you are dealing with when trouble-shooting technical issues.

9. Now this one is WordPress specific, but when it comes to security a HTTPS service is needed. But you can go a step further and update the htpasswd file in the root directory of the website with an encrption key (password), but you will need a custom-made file. To do so, use this site: <a href="https://hostingcanada.org/htpasswd-generator/"> htpasswd</a>

10. Every webdeveloper knows how difficult it is to deal with larger images. It can be solved with plugins on WordPress sites, but for stock-sites, that means compressing your images to deal with the load-time problem. I recommend <a href="https://tinypng.com/">tinypng </a> for both .jpy and .png files to get the compression rate and size you need.
