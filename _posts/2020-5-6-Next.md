Made some progress today with:
1. Updated my <a href="https://josephbalog.com/Portfolio/"> portfolio </a> CTA and fixed stuff..
2. Worked on the A-Z checklist of everything to make a WP site.
3. Need to watch my trial periods, as it cost me $99 bucks, but still got decent 1year subscriptions. Thank you.
