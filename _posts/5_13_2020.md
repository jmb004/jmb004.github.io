Made some progress today with:
1. Updated my <a href="https://josephbalog.com/Portfolio">Hiring Page</a> with a squeeze splash.
2. Learned about what a squeeze page was from <a href="https://youtu.be/sU_hSMSriuQ" Attract It Live <a>.
3. Discovered I can get really bored, even when things are going well. #staypostive.
