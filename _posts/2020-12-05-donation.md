#The story#
An Eastern Orthodox church had a new application for getting donations for it's parish. There was yet to be an analysis about how the app was influencing donation behavior.

#The data#
The data came from the app Tith.ly. It was donation data that needed to be anonymized in order to protect the community members. After this step, not done by this author, it was
formed into a table in a .csv. The data was cleaned and formatted. Inital frequency tables were made and descriptive statistics.

#Predictions#
The desire was expressed to forecast the donations. The Excel function Exponential Smoothing (ETS) was used for this across frequency and dollars.

#Visualization#
Then a dashboard was created with the requested descriptive statistics and simple graphs to show distributions. The workbook was wrapped up with a "Home" page to make accessing the various sheets easy.

#Wrapping it up#
The question was answered both visually and in simple statistics and gave a glimpse into the impact the donation platform Tith.ly was using for the congregations financial health. It would be good to
be able to track the changes in the giving amounts over time per giving unit and create a normalization across 5-years so that better predications could be made.
