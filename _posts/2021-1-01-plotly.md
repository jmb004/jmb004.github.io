title: 'Exploring religious data to learn mapping with plotly.express'

## Backstory ##
My interest was to do some basic visual data analysis of a religion in the state of Michigan to understand the religion I belong to and how it is distributed throughout the state. The assumptions are that the data is publicaly available and I will use it to make a map in Python. I also will use Excel to manipulate and clean the data.

## Making the map ##
The data set, Longitudinal Religious Congregations and Membership File, 1980-2010, came from the [Association of Religious Data Archives](https://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Downloads/RCMSMGCY_DL2.asp). A guide I used for making the map was [plotly.com](https://plotly.com/python/choropleth-maps/). The idea was to map the various Orthodox adherents to a chloropath style map using the plotly package. Additional guidance on the library was found on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/choropleth-maps-101-using-plotly-5daf85e7275d).

I pre-processed the data in Excel. This was to filter down to Michigan data. What we are looking at is 3-dimensional long data that I want to analyze. I mean 3-dimensional because the variables I am interested in are # of Adherents, County, and Year. I want to focus on the most recent data to get a some-what recent snap-shot of the distribution of adherents.

## The Problem ##
The problem arises when multiple data points have the same FIPS. ON my first map it was clear that the various data points for one County were not represented but only the first. For example, if Alleghan County has 3 sub-groups of Orthodox relgion and each have a membership count, then only the first sub-group by as read numerically from the .csv would be mapped. Simply, how does the mapping function work to read in the data accounting for this? I could not find a direct answer to this question, so I decided to play around with options to learn how it operates.

## Possible Solutions ##
There a few options: reduce the variables in the data set to only 2 (i.e., reduce the variables Year and Group to 1) so that the map is a plot of 2 variables. Or, use another parameter of the function to create a 3rd dimension. This would only look different and maybe be harder to interpret quickly. The question is, what do I want to show?

First, I decided to simplify the dataset to 1 year, 2010, and change the scope of the interesting variable (Orthodox denominations) into 1 variable of interest. This allows for a strict 2-variable scale to show the number of adherents by county. You get a snap-shot as opposed to scalar dataset.

I used the second option found in the [function](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.express.choropleth) to create a "subplot" to show that data. Using the facet_row method, it creates multiple maps for each variable selected. It looks messy even with only a little over a dozen grouping variables.

Then I remembered another method: use the animation_frame method to showcase the various groups while still only in 1 year. While "unorthodox" (pun intended) in method, since this parameter is usually for time, it is a way to see the geographical division by group.

This discovery, that a chloropleth map is actually a plot with geophical data (FIPS here) on the vertical axis is one that helps shape the way the data is fed into the mapping function. While other solutions may exist, it seems that that pre-processing the data to remove or reduce a variable is the easiet route. I have not read of other users finding this to be a problem with there data. In fact, the assumption seems to be that the map processes the merging of FIPS rows with multiple datapoints in a satisfactorly way. If that's a correct assumption, I have to disagree.
