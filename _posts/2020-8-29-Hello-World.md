How do I find someone who builds websites?
My target audience is the person in need a of new website. They could be a blogger, a small business owner / entrepreneur, or non-profit.
One problem they face amongst all of them right now, is the question of, "who do I know that can build me a website?".

They search their network. Facebook, LinkedIn, telephone list. They are connected with professionals in different spaces, but any website designers?
None. While everyone uses websites everyday for nearly every aspect of their lives, we rarely consider the people behind the face the of the internet. But surely, someone knows someone?

What about the freelance gig websites? FIVRR, UpWork, Hired. They are full of 1000's of freelance web-developers. Especially WordPress developers. They are in droves, with any number of certifications, qualifications and skillsets. What do you about picking one?

What if you knew someone who knew someone who knew someone? A third-degree connection. A stranger. A completely new look on finding a link a the network who can help you build that site that you have been dreaming of. Even if it's a foggy dream.

When you go garage-sale hunting (which I love), do you worry much about who the people are who you are buying from? Not especially. The neighborhood, maybe, which gives you a general idea of the type and quality of goods sold, but you wouldn't say, need to buy from someone who is only a "trusted" neighbor in your own block. No, you see the sign or find the address on Facebook and go to the house, scope it out, and find the gem you are looking for.

That's the same with finding a website developer. You need a website not the perfect developer or website builder. For a number of reasons you need a need site today: marketing (equals time-off from classic marketing), brand-awareness, an easier way to bring traffic to your cause, business, ideas. You want someone who is reliable, skilled, and who can deliver but they don't have to be in your trusted network, directly.

A 3rd degree connection. Today, your friend Susan met someone at networking event, John, who hired a landscaper Tim, who does websites on the side. Do you know Tim? No, but Susan said John seemed even-headed, so he must have a good read on his colleague. Plus, you can go on Facebook or LinkedIn and find John after Susan connects with him to check out his credentials. Then take the freelancer's number and give them a call or check their website like www.josephbalog.com.

There are a number of ways to find a freelance web-developer or website builder. But a lot of the websites that we use take time to set-up an account, get certified, and even then, take energy to comb the thousands of potential leads. With a network of family and friends, you can more quickly find someone. They may not be a direct connection, or even a friend-of-a-friend. But, maybe that distant network connection will be the "perfect" match for your website needs.

Take a risk, it might work-out.
