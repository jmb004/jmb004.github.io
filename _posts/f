Made some progress today with:
1. Working with my client <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RockysProServices">Rocky's Pro Services</a> on business development and getting the site hosted.
2. Finishing touches on the <a href="https://josephbalog.com/Portfolio/"> portfolio</a>. Learned that the most progress comes in small steps.
3. Reminded that you don't have to try to impress people to get friends or influence people.
