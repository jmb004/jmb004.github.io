Made some progress today with:
1. Finished my development of <a href="https://josephbalog.com/Portfolio/"> portfolio </a> pages (the last Splash page).
2. Learned you could expose flaws in Bluehost backend by adding a user to the DB and changing some .htaccess files (Got NordVPN too!)
3. Focused on security plugins, updates, changes and learning what Bluehost already has given me. Thank you <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/jmb001/">Bluehost</a>!
