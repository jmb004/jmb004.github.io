Made some progress today with:
1. Finished my development of <a href="https://josephbalog.com/Portfolio/"> portfolio </a> pages (the last Splash page).
2. Learned you could expose flaws in Bluehost backend by adding a user to the DB and changing some .htaccess files (Got NovoGuard VPN too!)
3. Got the scoop that my website layout is okay and that BlueHost already has backups for 14 days and added SiteLock to my site for free!
