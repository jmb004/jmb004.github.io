Made some progress today with:
1. Recommend the <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Sucuri</a> plugin for WP .
2. Learned about Project Management <a href="https://www.invensislearning.com/resources/pmp/precedence-diagramming-method">Check out this aspect</a>.
3. Got an insight about testing, that I need to relearn HTML5 to pass the Fiverr test. #insights
